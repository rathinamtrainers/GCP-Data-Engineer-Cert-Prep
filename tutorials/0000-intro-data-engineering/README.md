# Introduction to Data Engineering

## What is Data Engineering?

**Data Engineering** is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure and systems that enable organizations to collect, store, process, and analyze data at scale.

Think of data engineers as the architects and builders of data highways - they create the pipelines and systems that move data from where it's created (source) to where it's needed (destination), transforming it along the way to make it useful for business decisions.

## Why is Data Engineering Important?

In today's world, companies generate massive amounts of data from:
- Customer transactions
- Website interactions
- IoT sensors
- Mobile apps
- Social media
- Internal systems

Without data engineers, this data would be:
- **Scattered** across different systems
- **Unusable** in its raw form
- **Inaccessible** to analysts and data scientists
- **Unreliable** with quality issues

Data engineers make data **accessible, reliable, and useful** for the entire organization.

## The Data Engineering Lifecycle

Data engineering follows a lifecycle with distinct stages:

### 1. **Generation** (Data Sources)
Where data originates:
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- APIs and web services
- File uploads (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
- Streaming sources (IoT sensors, clickstreams)
- Third-party data providers

### 2. **Ingestion** (Data Collection)
Moving data from sources into your system:
- **Batch ingestion**: Processing data in scheduled chunks (hourly, daily)
- **Real-time/streaming ingestion**: Processing data as it arrives (milliseconds to seconds)
- **CDC (Change Data Capture)**: Tracking and capturing database changes

**GCP Tools**: Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Datastream, Transfer Service

### 3. **Storage** (Data Warehouses & Lakes)
Where you keep the data:
- **Data Warehouses**: Structured, optimized for analytics (BigQuery, Snowflake)
- **Data Lakes**: Raw data in various formats (Cloud Storage)
- **Databases**: Operational data (Cloud SQL, Bigtable, Spanner, Firestore)
- **Object Storage**: Files and unstructured data (Cloud Storage)

**GCP Tools**: BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Bigtable, Spanner, Cloud SQL

### 4. **Transformation** (Data Processing)
Converting raw data into useful formats:
- **Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, fixing errors, handling missing values
- **Enriching**: Adding calculated fields, joining datasets
- **Aggregating**: Summarizing data (daily totals, averages)
- **Formatting**: Converting data types, standardizing formats

**GCP Tools**: Dataflow, Dataproc, BigQuery, Dataform, Data Fusion

### 5. **Serving** (Making Data Available)
Delivering data to end users:
- **Analytics & BI**: Dashboards and reports (Looker, Tableau)
- **Machine Learning**: Training models (Vertex AI, BigQuery ML)
- **Applications**: APIs serving data to apps
- **Data Products**: Datasets for other teams or customers

**GCP Tools**: BigQuery, Looker, Vertex AI, Analytics Hub

### 6. **Monitoring & Maintenance** (Operations)
Keeping systems running smoothly:
- **Performance monitoring**: Query speed, pipeline health
- **Cost optimization**: Managing cloud spending
- **Quality checks**: Data validation, anomaly detection
- **Disaster recovery**: Backups, failover systems

**GCP Tools**: Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, Data Quality tools

## What Does a Data Engineer Do?

### Core Responsibilities

1. **Build Data Pipelines**
   - Design ETL/ELT workflows (Extract, Transform, Load)
   - Schedule and orchestrate data processing
   - Handle both batch and streaming data

2. **Design Data Architecture**
   - Choose the right storage systems
   - Model data for optimal performance
   - Plan for scalability and growth

3. **Ensure Data Quality**
   - Validate data accuracy
   - Monitor for anomalies
   - Implement data governance

4. **Optimize Performance & Costs**
   - Tune queries and pipelines
   - Manage resource utilization
   - Control cloud spending

5. **Collaborate with Teams**

## Data Engineering vs Related Roles

| Role | Focus | Example Tasks |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Data Engineer** | Infrastructure & pipelines | Build ETL pipelines, design databases, optimize storage |
| **Data Analyst** | Business insights | Create reports, analyze trends, answer business questions |
| **Data Scientist** | Predictive modeling | Build ML models, statistical analysis, experimentation |
| **Analytics Engineer** | Data modeling for BI | Create dbt models, build BI dashboards, define metrics |
| **ML Engineer** | Production ML systems | Deploy models, build inference pipelines, monitor predictions |

**Think of it this way:**
- Data Engineers build the **foundation** (the kitchen and supply chain)
- Data Analysts use the data to **understand** what happened (the food critic)
- Data Scientists use the data to **predict** what will happen (the recipe innovator)

## Key Concepts Every Data Engineer Should Know

### 1. **ETL vs ELT**

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** - Traditional approach:
1. Extract data from sources
2. Transform it (clean, aggregate) in a processing engine
3. Load into warehouse

**ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** - Modern approach:
1. Extract data from sources
2. Load raw data directly into warehouse
3. Transform inside the warehouse (leveraging its compute power)

*Modern data warehouses like BigQuery prefer ELT because they can handle transformations efficiently.*

### 2. **Batch vs Streaming**

**Batch Processing:**
- Process data in scheduled intervals (hourly, daily)
- Good for: Historical analysis, reports, large-scale transformations
- Example: Daily sales report generated at midnight

**Streaming Processing:**
- Process data continuously as it arrives
- Good for: Real-time alerts, live dashboards, fraud detection
- Example: Detecting unusual credit card transactions instantly

### 3. **Data Modeling**

**Schema Design** - How you organize tables and relationships:

**Normalized (3NF):**
- Minimizes data duplication
- Many small tables with relationships
- Good for transactional systems (OLTP)

**Denormalized (Star/Snowflake Schema):**
- Combines related data into fewer tables
- Faster queries, some duplication
- Good for analytics (OLAP)

Example:
```
Normalized:
- customers table (id, name)
- orders table (id, customer_id, date)
- order_items table (id, order_id, product_id, quantity)

Denormalized (for analytics):
- sales_fact table (order_id, customer_name, product_name, quantity, date, total)
```

### 4. **Partitioning & Clustering**

Strategies to make large datasets query faster:

**Partitioning:** Dividing data into chunks based on a column (usually date)
- Example: One partition per day
- Benefit: Only scan relevant partitions, not entire table

**Clustering:** Sorting data within partitions by specific columns
- Example: Cluster by customer_id within each day
- Benefit: Skip irrelevant blocks of data

### 5. **Data Quality Dimensions**

- **Accuracy**: Data is correct and reflects reality
- **Completeness**: No missing required values
- **Consistency**: Same data has same values across systems
- **Timeliness**: Data is available when needed
- **Validity**: Data conforms to defined formats and rules

## Common Tools & Technologies

### Languages
- **SQL**: Essential - querying and transforming data
- **Python**: Most popular for data pipelines (pandas, Apache Beam)
- **Java/Scala**: Used with big data tools (Spark, Hadoop)

### Orchestration
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow scheduling (Cloud Composer on GCP)
- **Workflows**: Serverless orchestration on GCP
- **Dagster/Prefect**: Modern alternatives

### Processing Frameworks
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed batch/streaming processing (Dataproc on GCP)
- **Apache Beam**: Unified batch/streaming model (Dataflow on GCP)
- **dbt**: SQL-based transformation framework

### Cloud Platforms
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub
- **AWS**: Redshift, Glue, Kinesis
- **Azure**: Synapse, Data Factory, Event Hubs

   - CDC from PostgreSQL database using **Datastream**
   - Hourly inventory API sync to **Cloud Storage**
   - Daily CSV uploads to **Cloud Storage**

2. **Storage**
   - Raw data lands in **Cloud Storage** (data lake)
   - Processed data in **BigQuery** tables (data warehouse)

3. **Transformation** (using Dataflow/BigQuery)
   - Clean and deduplicate clickstream data
   - Join orders with customer data
   - Calculate metrics: conversion rate, average order value
   - Aggregate daily sales by product category

4. **Serving**
   - **Looker** dashboards for business users
   - **BigQuery ML** model to predict customer churn
   - **API** serving real-time inventory to website

5. **Orchestration** (Cloud Composer)
   - DAG runs hourly:
     1. Check for new inventory data
     2. Trigger Dataflow transformation job
     3. Update BigQuery tables
     4. Refresh Looker cache
     5. Send alert if errors occur

6. **Monitoring**
   - Pipeline runs logged to **Cloud Logging**
