## 📖 How to Use These Materials

### Active Learning Approach

**Don't just read - engage!**

1. **Take notes**: Write down key concepts in your own words
2. **Draw diagrams**: Sketch architectures as you learn
3. **Ask questions**: "Why would I use X instead of Y?"
4. **Make flashcards**: For GCP services and when to use them
5. **Do hands-on**: Complete projects after theory

### Study Techniques

**Spaced Repetition**:
- Day 1: Read README.md
- Day 2: Read DEEP_DIVE.md Sections 1-2
- Day 3: Review Day 1-2, add Sections 3-4
- Day 4: Review all, add Sections 5-7
- Day 7: Review everything
- Day 14: Review everything again

**Feynman Technique**:
1. Pick a concept (e.g., "Lambda Architecture")
2. Explain it out loud as if teaching someone
3. Identify gaps in your understanding
4. Go back and study those gaps
5. Repeat until you can explain simply

**Practice Questions**:
After each section, ask yourself:
- "When would I use this?"
- "What are the tradeoffs?"
- "How does this compare to alternatives?"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "How much would this cost?"
