---

## What Was NOT Deleted

The following resources were intentionally preserved or are outside project scope:

### GCP Project
- Project ID: `data-engineer-475516`
- **Reason**: May be used for other certification projects

### IAM Permissions
- Service Agent role: `roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext` for `service-434782524071@cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Reason**: Google-managed service account, no cost

### Default Service Accounts
- Compute Engine default service account: `434782524071-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Reason**: Used by Composer, managed by Google, no cost

### Local Files
- All project code, scripts, and documentation preserved in repository
- Location: `/home/rajan/research/gcp/GCP-Data-Engineer-Cert-Prep/projects/01-batch-etl-weather/`

---

## Verification Commands

To verify all resources are deleted, run:

```bash
# Check Composer environments (should return empty)
gcloud composer environments list \
    --locations us-central1 \
    --project data-engineer-475516

# Check GCS buckets (should not find weather buckets)
gsutil ls -p data-engineer-475516 | grep -E "weather|composer"

# Check BigQuery datasets (should not find weather_data)
bq ls --project_id=data-engineer-475516 | grep -i weather

# Check service accounts (should not find dataflow-runner)
gcloud iam service-accounts list \
    --project data-engineer-475516 | grep dataflow-runner
```

**Expected Output**: All commands should return empty results or "not found" errors.

---

## Restoration Instructions

If you need to recreate the project resources later:

### Step 1: Recreate Service Account
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create dataflow-runner \
    --display-name="Dataflow Runner Service Account" \
    --project data-engineer-475516

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding data-engineer-475516 \
    --member="serviceAccount:dataflow-runner@data-engineer-475516.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/dataflow.worker"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding data-engineer-475516 \
    --member="serviceAccount:dataflow-runner@data-engineer-475516.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/bigquery.dataEditor"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding data-engineer-475516 \
    --member="serviceAccount:dataflow-runner@data-engineer-475516.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"
```

### Step 2: Recreate GCS Buckets
```bash
gsutil mb -l us-central1 gs://data-engineer-475516-weather-raw
gsutil mb -l us-central1 gs://data-engineer-475516-weather-temp
gsutil mb -l us-central1 gs://data-engineer-475516-weather-staging
```

### Step 3: Recreate BigQuery Dataset
```bash
bq mk --dataset \
    --location=US \
    --description="Weather data from OpenWeather API" \
    data-engineer-475516:weather_data
```

### Step 4: Recreate BigQuery Table
```bash
bq mk --table \
    data-engineer-475516:weather_data.daily \
    src/schemas/weather_schema.json
```

### Step 5: Recreate Composer Environment (OPTIONAL - EXPENSIVE)
```bash
# Only if you need Airflow orchestration
gcloud composer environments create weather-etl-composer \
    --location us-central1 \
    --image-version composer-2.9.9-airflow-2.9.3 \
    --environment-size small \
    --service-account 434782524071-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
    --project data-engineer-475516
```

**Note**: Composer creation takes ~20-30 minutes and costs ~$150-200/month.

## GCP Certification Topics Covered

This project addressed Professional Data Engineer exam topics:

### Section 2: Ingesting and Processing Data (~25%)
- Batch data pipelines with Apache Beam
- Dataflow job deployment and monitoring
- Cloud Composer orchestration with Airflow
- Data validation and quality checks

### Section 3: Storing the Data (~20%)
- BigQuery table design with partitioning
- GCS bucket organization
- Data retention strategies

### Section 5: Maintaining and Automating Workloads (~18%)
- Resource cleanup and cost optimization
- Monitoring and logging
- Pipeline automation with Composer

---

## Next Steps

### If Continuing GCP Certification Study:
1. Review all documentation for retention
2. Move to next project (e.g., streaming pipelines, Pub/Sub)
3. Apply lessons learned to future projects

### If Recreating This Project:
1. Follow restoration instructions above
2. Update OpenWeather API key in environment variables
3. Re-run Dataflow pipeline: `bash run_dataflow_job.sh`
4. (Optional) Re-upload Airflow DAG to Composer

### Cost-Effective Alternatives to Composer:
- **Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Functions**: ~$0.50/month
- **Cron job on f1-micro VM**: ~$5/month
- **GitHub Actions (free tier)**: $0/month
- **Local cron (for learning)**: $0

---

## Lessons Learned

### Cost Management
- **Always delete expensive resources immediately after testing**
- Cloud Composer costs $5-7 per day even when idle
- Set up billing alerts before deploying resources
- Use `--quiet` flag to avoid interactive confirmations in scripts

### Resource Cleanup Best Practices
1. Delete most expensive resources first (Composer)
2. Run deletions in parallel when safe (GCS buckets)
3. Use `-f` flag for forced deletion when appropriate
4. Verify deletion with list commands
5. Document what was deleted and why

### Cloud Composer Specific
- Composer deletion takes 10-15 minutes
- Deleting environment auto-deletes associated GCS bucket
- GKE cluster and Cloud SQL are hidden costs
- For learning, consider Cloud Functions + Scheduler instead
